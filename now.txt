I'm looking forward to warmer days and trying to make the most of my time now. My goal until the end of spring is to publish 2 more journal papers.

Right now I'm focusing on:
- Preparing a new article to publish
- Expanding my project portfolio
- Bringing down my screen time
- Catching up on learning kanji

Reading now:
- Grokking Algorithms by Aditya Y Bhargava

Podcasts in rotation:
- Deep Questions with Cal Newport

Listening on repeat now:
- slowed and reverbed, pt.1 - Lil Skele
- 2EYES - login
- 110° - Softheart
- ロキ - みきとP
